Project Overview
This project consists of two main parts:  

1. Speech-to-Text System:  
   - A web-based application that allows users to upload audio files and receive transcriptions.  
   - It includes a frontend interface ('stt.py') and a backend model for transcription ('model.py').  
   - The output of the transcription is demonstrated in the included 'result.png' file.  

2. SQL Case Study:  
   - A database analysis of a food delivery system (Zomato case study).  
   - SQL queries are provided to extract insights from the dataset.
